# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?

Chetrapal Rathore (Amit)


## How difficult was this assignment?

Pretty difficult at the beginning as I had no clue where to start. But after doing some research and tutorials, it got better. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

Ionic is pretty neat, I like how we can develop cross-platform whether that be for ios/android. I might use this more now and for projects outside of school. Though I know there are drawbacks for using Ionic compared to natively building such as in Xcode or Android Studio.


## How could this assignment be improved?

It is a challenge to complete so there is no need to improve. Good assignment to introduce Ionic.


## Any other comments?

I'm hungry. Send food. Thank you.
